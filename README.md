# SpawnerProtect
A very simple Minecraft plugin that prevents players from modifying mob spawners with monster eggs unless given express permission.

Requires Spigot 1.9.2

There are issues with the PermissionsEx Maven repository, so I ended up compiling it as a local module instead.


Players will need the permission "spawnerprotect.admin" to be able to change a spawner's type.
